```

### 2. Load into Chrome
1. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Auto Capture**: The extension automatically detects the title and URL of your current tab.
- **Emoji Categories**:
  - 💼 **Work**: For professional or job-related links.
  - 🏠 **Personal**: For personal interests and hobbies.
  - ⏳ **Watch Later**: For articles or videos you want to check out later.
- **Save**: Clicking "Save to Brain" sends a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/api/save` (configurable in `App.jsx`).

## ⚡ Development

If you want to modify the design or functionality:
1. Edit files in `src/`.
2. Run `npm run build` to update the `dist` folder.
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the **Update** icon (circular arrow) on the extension card.
